# web-scraping-challenge
This is the repo for the unit 12 homework on webscraping.
It includes several files.
The first file is a jupyter notebook with the original web scraping code.
This was then converted into a python file scrape_mars for use in the Flask app.
The Flask app.py file is also included.
Finally, there is a template file (index.html) to display the scraped data and
an image of the function app.
